        brew install python
    %h3#linux
        Linux
    %h4#debian
        Debian/Ubuntu

        If you're using Debian, Ubuntu or another similair distro, you already have python installed.
        If you don't, run in your terminal:
        %pre
            sudo apt update
            sudo apt install python3
    %h4#arch
        Arch/Manjaro
    %p
        If you're using Manjaro you most likely have it installed.
        Otherwise, if you're using arch, run in your terminal:
        %pre
            sudo pacman -S python
    %h4#source
        Source

            cd cpython
            \./configure
